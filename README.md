AKAN NAME 

This project has been created by Victor Kuria.

The project is a website that allows the user to know their Akan names. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The website allows the user to enter their year of birth and gender and it will produce their Akan names.
